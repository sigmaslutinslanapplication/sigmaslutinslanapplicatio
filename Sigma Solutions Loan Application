A payday loan is a short term loan that is intended to cover a borrower's expenses until his or her next payday.

Payday loans, also known as cash advances, can easily be obtained by submitting an online application form. These forms usually take less than five minutes to fill out.

Once a payday loan lender receives your application, they will call you to verify the information you provided on your application form online. They will also verify your employment and any other source of income you may receive. Individual companies have their own rules. Some companies require you to have held a job for at least 6 months and to have an active checking account of at least 3 months.

After verifying your personal, employment and bank information, the cash advance lender decides to approve or reject your loan application based on their criteria.

While most companies have a long list of requirements, some companies have very basic requirements. You must be at least eighteen years old, own a bank account and have a job (making at-least $1000 a month after taxes).
